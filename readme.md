DESKTOP GUI

For doing useful python things easily

To do:

- Add multithreading so scrapers can run at same time as using the GUI
- Add a popup to property scraper if there are more than 50 pages to confirm if you want to continue

- Somehow find out how to get cross-file function calls working without getting attribute error for local variables!!
